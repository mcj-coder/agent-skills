  Use this skill whenever deploying or auditing environments to ensure each
  environment can be mapped to explicit component versions and tags, preserving
  immutable provenance.

# Environment Deployment Traceability Review

## Intent
Ensure environments have an explicit, reviewable record of what component
versions/tags are deployed, enabling auditability and reliable rollbacks.

---

## When to Use
- Before and after deployments to any environment
- During incident response or rollback planning
- During compliance or audit reviews

---

## Precondition Failure Signal
- Environment state cannot be expressed as component versions/tags
- Deployments are not tied to immutable release identifiers
- Rollbacks require guesswork or manual archaeology
- Multiple versions appear deployed without clear explanation

---

## Postcondition Success Signal
- Environment state lists each deployed component version and tag
- Deployments are traceable to immutable release inputs
- Rollback candidates are identifiable and verifiable
- Traceability records are reproducible from source-of-truth artifacts

---

## Example Test / Validation
- For an environment, produce a component→version→tag mapping and verify it matches reality (conceptually)
- Select a deployed version and verify the tag identifies the source state
- Demonstrate rollback selection using recorded versions/tags

---

## Common Red Flags / Guardrail Violations
- “We’ll track it in a spreadsheet”
- Deploying without tagging because “it’s only dev”
- Allowing mutable references (“latest”, “main”) in deployments
- Inconsistent component naming/versioning across environments

---

## Recommended Review Personas
- **Platform/DevOps Engineer** – validates traceability mechanisms and records
- **Tech Lead** – validates alignment to release discipline and scope
- **Security/Compliance Reviewer** – validates provenance and audit needs

## Skill Priority
P0 – Safety & Integrity

---

## Conflict Resolution Rules
- Overrides all lower-priority skills
- No environment promotion without traceability evidence unless escalated
- Traceability cannot be traded for speed

---

## Conceptual Dependencies
- release-tagging-plan
- incremental-deployment

## Notes
Traceability is a system property. If it’s optional, it won’t exist when needed.
