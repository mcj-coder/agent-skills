# Requesting Code Review

## Intent

Make reviews effective by providing context, evidence, and a clear checklist
before asking for feedback.

---

## When to Use

- Before submitting a PR.
- After completing a major task or batch.
- When requesting architectural guidance.

---

## Precondition Failure Signal

- Review requested without verification evidence.
- Reviewer lacks context or specific areas of concern.
- "LGTM" given without objective criteria.

---

## Postcondition Success Signal

- Review request includes goal, scope, risks, and evidence.
- Reviewer knows what to focus on.
- Review checklist is explicit.

---

## Process

1. **Self-Review**: Inspect VCS diff and run `verification-and-handover`.
2. **Prepare Summary**:
   - Goal and scope.
   - Impacted areas.
   - Verification commands and results.
   - Known risks or concerns.
3. **Request Review**:
   - Provide context and links to relevant files.
   - Ask for review of specific areas.
4. **Track Response**: Record feedback for `receiving-code-review`.
