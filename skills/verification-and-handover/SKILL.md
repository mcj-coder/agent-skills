  Use this skill whenever claiming a task is complete, a bug is fixed, or 
  preparing to handover/submit work to ensure all success criteria are met with evidence.

# Verification & Handover

## Intent

Ensure that all completed work is objectively verified through evidence before any claims of success or completion are made. This eliminates "false greens," prevents broken builds, and ensures high-quality handovers between team members.

---

## When to Use

- Before committing code or creating a Pull Request.
- Before claiming a bug is fixed or a requirement is met.
- Before moving to the next task in a plan.
- Whenever about to express "satisfaction" with the current state.
- Before marking any plan task or deliverable as complete (status changes count as claims).

---

## Precondition Failure Signal

- "Should work now" or "Seems fixed" (claims without evidence).
- Committing without running the full test suite for impacted components.
- Linter or build errors discovered _after_ claiming completion.
- Requirements checklist is missing or incomplete.
- Plan/task status marked "Done/Delivered" before evidence is recorded.

---

## Postcondition Success Signal

- The "Iron Law": EVIDENCE BEFORE CLAIMS.
- Every claim is accompanied by fresh, specific verification output (e.g., test results, build logs).
- A final line-by-line requirements check has been performed.
- Compilation and quality gates (LTS, zero warnings) are verified green (see `quality-gate-enforcement`).
- Plan/task status is only updated to complete after evidence is documented (no retroactive proof).

---

## Process

1. **Identify**: What command or check proves the current claim?
2. **Execute**: Run the FULL command (fresh, complete). Do not rely on previous runs or partial checks.
3. **Analyze**: Read the full output. Check exit codes and failure counts.
4. **Verify**: Does the output explicitly confirm the claim?
5. **Document**: Record evidence first, then state the claim WITH the supporting evidence (or a reference to it).
6. **Update Status**: Only after Step 5, update any plan/task status to Done/Delivered and include the evidence reference.
7. **Handover**: For final completion, perform a "VCS check" (diff review) to ensure no unintended changes or debug code are included.

---

## Example Test / Validation

- **Claim**: "Tests pass".
- **Evidence**: `[Run: npm run test:all] -> 34/34 pass, 0 fail. (exit 0)`.
- **Claim**: "Requirement X met".
- **Evidence**: `[Checklist: Item X verified against implementation in UserService.cs:45]`.

---

## Common Red Flags / Guardrail Violations

- Expressing satisfaction before verification ("Perfect!", "Done!").
- Trusting "Agent success" reports without checking the VCS diff.
- Relying on partial verification (e.g., "Linter passed, so build will pass").
- Skipping verification because of "time pressure" or exhaustion.
- Updating plan/task status before evidence is written down.

---

## Recommended Review Personas

- **Tech Lead** – validates the checklist against requirements.
- **Platform Engineer** – validates that build/test evidence is complete and reproducible.

## Conflict Resolution Rules

- Verification is non-negotiable and cannot be skipped for delivery speed.
- If verification fails, return to the appropriate implementation or debugging skill immediately.

## Notes

Claiming work is complete without verification is a failure of honesty and professional discipline. Evidence is the only currency in engineering.
