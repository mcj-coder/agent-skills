  Use this skill whenever preparing local or CI execution to build and test only
  the impacted components identified by change impact analysis, while preserving
  quality gates and correctness.

# Selective Build & Test Planning

## Intent
Plan and execute only the necessary builds and tests for impacted components,
based on an explicit impact assessment, while maintaining full quality and
correctness standards.

---

## When to Use
- Before local build/test runs in a monorepo
- When configuring or reviewing CI behaviour for incremental execution
- When optimising feedback loops without weakening standards

---

## Precondition Failure Signal
- Full repo builds/tests run for small changes
- Incremental runs miss required tests for impacted components
- Developers bypass checks because “it takes too long”
- CI outputs cannot explain why a component did/did not run

---

## Postcondition Success Signal
- Build/test matrix includes all and only impacted components
- Required transitive tests are included where dependencies demand it
- Quality gates remain unchanged; only the scope is reduced
- Execution is reproducible and reviewable from the same inputs

---

## Process
1. **Source Review**: Inspect the impact set produced by `incremental-change-impact` and determine the appropriate testing tier (UnitTest, SystemTest, ComponentE2E, E2E, ArchitectureTest) based on the current execution stage (Dev, Pre-commit, Pre-push, CI/CD).
2. **Implementation**: Configure the build/test tool (e.g., `nx affected`, `dotnet test --filter`) to only target the identified components and tiers.
3. **Verification**: Execute the build/test and verify that only the intended components and tiers were processed and that they passed.
4. **Documentation**: Document the selective execution plan, including which tiers were run and why.
5. **Review**: Platform/DevOps Engineer and Tech Lead review the selective execution results for correctness, coverage, and alignment with the test execution matrix.

---

## Example Test / Validation
- Change a single component and verify only that component’s build/tests run
- Introduce a dependency change and verify dependent components are included
- Confirm quality gates are identical to full runs for impacted components

---

## Common Red Flags / Guardrail Violations
- Skipping pre-commit hooks or checks “to save time”
- Reducing scope by suppressing tests rather than proving non-impact
- Disabling warnings-as-errors or lint rules to speed up builds
- Incremental logic that is not reproducible or explainable

---

## Recommended Review Personas
- **Platform/DevOps Engineer** – validates correctness of incremental execution
- **Tech Lead** – validates standards are not weakened and scope is justified
- **Domain Expert** – validates dependency assumptions

---

## Skill Priority
P3 – Delivery & Flow  
(Must never override P0–P2 constraints.)

---

## Conflict Resolution Rules
- Must consume the output of incremental-change-impact
- Cannot weaken quality gates; only reduces scope
- If uncertainty exists, broaden scope rather than suppress checks (with justification)

---

## Conceptual Dependencies
- incremental-change-impact
- quality-gate-enforcement

---

## Classification
Operational

## Notes
Optimise feedback loops, not standards. Faster is acceptable only when correct. Refer to the repository's "Test Execution Matrix" for stage-specific tier requirements.
