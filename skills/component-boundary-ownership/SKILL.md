  Use this skill when deciding where functionality should live (slice-local vs

  aligned to reuse evidence and deployment boundaries.

# Component Boundary & Ownership Review

## Intent
Ensure functionality is located in the correct boundary with clear ownership,
avoiding premature abstraction and accidental coupling.

---

## When to Use
- Introducing new functionality that might be reused
- Reviewing PRs that move code across boundaries
- Deciding whether something is slice-local or shared
- Resolving duplication across components

---

## Precondition Failure Signal
- Functionality placed in shared areas without proven reuse
- Slice-local logic extracted prematurely “for future reuse”
- Ownership is unclear (who maintains this code?)
- Coupling increases because shared code pulls in unrelated dependencies

---

## Postcondition Success Signal
- Functionality is placed where it best matches current usage and ownership
- Shared abstractions exist only when reuse is real and justified
- Boundaries are explicit and support independent build/test/deploy
- Duplication decisions are intentional and reviewable

---

## Process
1. **Source Review**: Inspect the current code location, its callers, and potential future reuse points.
2. **Implementation**: Move or refactor code to the appropriate boundary (slice-local or shared).
3. **Verification**: Run build and test for the affected and related components to ensure no boundary violations or unintended coupling.
4. **Documentation**: Record the reasoning for placement in an ADR if it defines or changes architectural boundaries.
5. **Review**: Tech Lead and Architecture/Domain Expert review the placement and ownership decision.

---

## Example Test / Validation
- Demonstrate reuse evidence (multiple consumers) before extracting
- Verify moving code does not introduce cross-slice coupling
- Confirm ownership and responsibility are clear post-change

---

## Common Red Flags / Guardrail Violations
- “We might need this elsewhere later”
- Creating shared utilities to avoid small duplication
- Adding dependencies to shared libraries that force consumers to import unrelated concerns
- Moving code from other repos without checking other consumers

---

## Recommended Review Personas
- **Tech Lead** – validates boundaries, ownership, and YAGNI discipline
- **Architecture/Domain Expert** – validates coupling/cohesion and design intent
- **Platform Engineer** – validates build/deploy boundary implications

---

## Skill Priority
P2 – Consistency & Governance

---

## Conflict Resolution Rules
- Default to slice-local unless reuse is proven
- If duplication exists, prefer extracting only the stable, minimal shared portion
- If reuse scope is unclear across repos/projects, escalate before relocation

---

## Conceptual Dependencies
- incremental-change-impact
- scoped-colocation

## Classification
Governance

## Notes
The goal is not “maximum reuse”; it is “minimum coupling with justified reuse.”
